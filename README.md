## Description
![Screen Shot 2021-09-12 at 12 46 07 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33183884/132972588-0d87a242-dc0d-4692-99d7-d522602bb555.png)

Though many people express a desire to shop more in their communities, they often run into difficulties in finding a local retailer that matches both their price range and needs. 

Lokal aims to facilitate that connection between consumer and retailer, with a mobile application designed to connect consumers with small retailers in their communities. Using our app, users can search for a variety of services including restaurants, bakeries, grocers, thrift stores, and more, all owned and operated by small business owners in their town. Lokal also helps small businesses put their best foot forward, allowing them to share pictures, videos, links, etc. with ease.

See the [business plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13vt3c9TlZ5PJ90tMJDdWALq43StjfD0Goq5oDT-WR8Q/edit?usp=sharing) for more details (created by Catherine Zhang, Eric Xu, Ivan Mudarth, Oren Leung, Shajan Kamalanathan, and Stephanie Xiang).
